Sursilvan Romansh - German dictionary app for <CUSTOMIZE_HERE>Android/iOS. You can type a word in German or Sursilvan Romansh and it will display some results from web sources and link to the original results.

The app shows results from the following websites:
* https://www.vocabularisursilvan.ch/, Niev Vocabulari Sursilvan, www.vocabularisursilvan.ch
* http://www.pledari.ch/meinpledari/index.php, MeinPledari, www.pledari.ch/meinpledari/

The results are displayed in the app directly so you know which website has results at all. By clicking the blue headlines you can get to the full results of the original website. The websites will then provide much more information about the Romansh words.

I hope this will help the very small Sursilvan community to keep their language alive. More information about Sursilvan: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sursilvan_dialects_(Romansh)

The complete program code to create this app is freely available (Open Source) and can be found on the following URL:  https://github.com/floyd-fuh/SursilvanCordova

As I am not working in the area of mobile app development, I appreciate every help in the area of development and especially design. The app is free, without any in-app purchases and does not display any ads.

##Further info

As the store listing doesn't allow Sursilvan Romansh as a language and it's a dictionary app from/to German, it's labeled as German. However, the entire app UI is in Sursilvan Romansh. The language is near extinction but still very important regionally (about 35'000 speakers). The Romansh language is still the official fourth language of Switzerland. According to my research the Apple App store completely lacks any app related to this language. A lot of native speakers are already looking forward to this app to support them in their daily lifes in the German speaking surrounded area.
